The HTSlib header files are located in src/htslib-1.7/htslib/ and will be copied
to ${R_PACKAGE_DIR}/include/htslib/ at installation time. See the mk-include-dir
and populate-include-dir targets in src/Makevars for how this mechanism is
implemented.

For convenience, some .h and .c files from Samtools are also included here
and will end up in ${R_PACKAGE_DIR}/include/ at installation time. Note that
these files come from the top-level folder of the Samtools 1.7 source tree.

Finally, because recent versions of Samtools no longer support RAZF but some
Bioconductor packages still need it (e.g. BSgenome, seqbias, etc...), we also
include razf.c and razf.h from Samtools 0.1.19 in inst/include/razf
